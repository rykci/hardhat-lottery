# Smart Contract Lottery Hardhat Project

1. This smart contract allows users to fund the contract (with some minimum amount) when the state of the lottery is open.
2. The deployer of the contract is considered to be the admin and decides when to close the lottery.
3. Randomly decides a winner and the contract balance is sent to their account
